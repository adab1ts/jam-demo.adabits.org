We believe that content management shouldn’t be hard, that websites should be able to outlive their CMS. Our tools should be simple, but never dumbed down.

Best of all, unlike legacy CMSs such as WordPress and Drupal, your website’s entire source code and content are completely portable. Never be locked into a particular service again.

***An Open Web is a better web.***
