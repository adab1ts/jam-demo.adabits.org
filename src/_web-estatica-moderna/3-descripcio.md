  - titol: "Web Standards benefits"
    descripcio: "Web Standards are about using standards (Structural, presentational, Object and Scripting languages) and best practices (valid, semantic and accessible code) to benefit your users. Web Standards ensure the long-term viability of any web document, simplify code and lower the cost of production and deliver sites that are accessible to more people and more devices."

  - titol: "Solid Security"
    descripcio: "If you’re using a popular CMS, you know about the necessary security measures. This is mostly due to the login page being available to anyone with access to the website and some basic knowledge of the specific CMS. With a static website, a login page doesn’t exist. With server-side processes abstracted into microservice APIs, surface areas for attacks are reduced. You can also leverage the domain expertise of specialist third-party services."

  - titol: "Faster loading times"
    descripcio: "The fact that JAMstack websites don’t have to make any calls to a database makes the loading time exponentially quicker. A faster site = better user experience & Google rankings."
    icona: "Shop-2"
  - titol: "Manteniment & escalabilitat"
    descripcio: "Cheaper, Easier Scaling: We’re not dealing with expensive runtimes or complicated server setups — we’re only dealing with static files being served on the client side. No database, no plugins = no need of maintenance."

  - titol: "Accessibilitat"
    descripcio: "Why use accessible code? Allows your site to be accessible to a larger audience (vision impaired, motor skill impaired, cognitive impaired). Allows your site to be accessed by wider range of devices (hand helds, screen readers, text browsers, search engines). Better SEO."

  - titol: "APIs flexibility"
    descripcio: "Front-End and CMS are Decoupled, you don’t have a CMS dictating the way you should structure your content and pages. Not having a CMS tied in to the presentation layer gives you the flexibility of creating anything you want on the front-end while using the API endpoints to pull in content."

The JAMstack is not about specific technologies. It’s a new way of building websites and apps that delivers better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a better experience.

Thanks to modern browsers, static site generators, CDNs, and APIs, web developement has shift from the backend to the now powerful frontend. From Jekyll-specific apps to headless API-first CMS, these static tools come in all shapes and sizes.
